# Feature Plan: Phase 7 - Integration, Stress Testing, and Release Hardening

## Overview
Phase 7 converts bench-tested firmware into competition-ready system through comprehensive stress testing and documentation.

## Requirements
- FR-1: Electrical stress tests (rapid changes, concurrent loads)
- FR-2: RF stress tests (range, link loss, interference)
- FR-3: Thermal tests (extended operation)
- FR-4: Operator documentation (quick start, troubleshooting)
- FR-5: LED status patterns fully implemented

## Success Criteria
- SC-1: 20+ safe power cycles
- SC-2: 5+ minutes continuous operation without issues
- SC-3: All safety requirements verified
- SC-4: Documentation complete
